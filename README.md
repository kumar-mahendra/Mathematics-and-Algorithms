Exploring Various `Algorithms` I come across and then tried to `implement` them using some `programming language` in a way it can be easily understood.

 ### Table of Contents
- `Naive Gauss Algorithm` - This Algorithm can be used to solve a system of equation of form Ax = b , where A is invertible and diagonal entries are non-zero. To know more [see here](https://github.com/kumar-mahendra/Mathematics_of_Scientific_Computing/blob/main/Naive_Gauss_method.ipynb)

- `Thomas Algorithm` - An special case of Naive Gauss when system is tridiagoal matrix . i.e. except superdiagonal, maindiagonal, sub-diagonal all entries are zero. Time complexity is O(N) .

- `Merge-Sort` - Using Original array to do sorting and thus reducing space complexity.

- `Quick-Sort` -  Using random pivoting technique  to sort array.
