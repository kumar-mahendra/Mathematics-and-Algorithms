# Algorithms in linear algebra

1.  `Naive gauss algorithm`   
    - Used to solve system of equation of form Ax = b  where A is invertible 
    - Time complexity : O(N^2)

2. `Thomas algorithm` 
    - A special case of naive gauss algorithm 
    - Used to solve system of equation of type Ax = b where A is tridiagonal matrix with one additional condition 
    - Time complexity : O(N)

3. `Iterative algorithms` 
    - Richarson method 
    - Jacobi method 

4. `Page rank algorithm` 
    - Simple version of **Google's pagerank algorithm**
    - Rank webpages based on their pagerank 
    - pre-requisites : knowledge of eigen-values and power-iterative method 

5. `(Batch)_gradient_descent_algorithm` 
    - Used to find optimize parameters of linear hypothesis function in machine learning
